# Vendit-Persistent-Shops — Foundry VTT v12
Persistent, scene-aware vending machines for Cyberpunk RED with 2077/2045 era skins, generated Monk's Tile Binder, active-scene CitiNet location pings, configurable player proximity, dynamic stock, Simple Calendar background traffic, curated pricing and safer Tile template lifecycle handling.

Module creation assisted by AI from macro v3.0.3, legacy macro can be found in Cyberpunk Red Foundry VTT Discord content sharing.

Version **1.2.5** keeps the existing `vendit.db` world setting while polishing the module into a dedicated Vendit retail interface for both 2077 and 2045.

## Installation

1. Back up the world.
2. Replace `{Foundry User Data}/Data/modules/vendit` with the `vendit` folder from this ZIP.
3. Restart Foundry VTT and enable **Vendit™ Persistent Shops**.
4. Hard-refresh connected browsers.

Existing shops, dynamic settings, stock, prices, sale schedules, and Tile flags remain under the same module ID/database.

## Vendit UI skins

- **2077:** deep-black retail terminal with cyan chrome and yellow machine accents.
- **2045:** the same Vendit layout with the established `#E64539` redline accent and warm amber secondary highlights.
- CitiNet card styling/content is preserved, but the action button now **PINGs the Vendit location** instead of opening the shop remotely.

## Generated Monk's Active Tiles binder

The Binder now uses the bundled `modules/vendit/assets/Vendit.webp` icon. Existing module-generated Binder macros are automatically updated to the bundled Vendit icon on startup, while an unrelated/custom macro that merely shares the name is left alone unless you explicitly use **Create / Repair Binder Macro**.

The module automatically creates **Vendit™ Binder** for the primary GM if it is missing. It can also be repaired from Vendit Options or Dynamic Network.

Use the generated macro as the Run Macro action on Vendit Tiles. For Tile-bound Vendits, leave the MATT argument field blank. Static/private machines may continue using `id=YOUR-ID`.

Canonical Binder command:

```js
return game.vendit.run({
  args: typeof args === "undefined" ? null : args,
  tile: typeof tile === "undefined" ? null : tile,
  token: typeof token === "undefined" ? null : token,
  actor: typeof actor === "undefined" ? null : actor
});
```

## Player proximity & CitiNet location pings

Tile-bound Vendits are physical machines. Players must be within **2 grid spaces** by default before the player shop opens. The range can be changed under **Vendit™ Options → Player Interaction Range (grid spaces)**. GMs can Preview from anywhere.

The generated Binder forwards both the triggering Tile and Token, so existing MATT Vendit Tiles do not need a separate Distance action. Manually bound or auto-generated Tiles inherit the proximity gate automatically.

CitiNet flash-price cards no longer provide remote shopping. Their button is **PING LOCATION**: it pans to the bound Vendit Tile and triggers Foundry's native map ping on the active Scene. Only Vendits with a physical Tile binding are eligible for automatic CitiNet location ads. Old chat cards with the former OPEN button are also treated as pings after upgrade.

## Auto-Tile Template

The Auto-Tile Template is a **blueprint**, not a master inventory. It copies the selected Vendit's dynamic configuration, source tables/packs, curated pools, quantity/cycle settings, and sale rules to newly created Tiles whose name/image matches the configured keywords.

Each matched Tile receives:

- a unique Vendit ID;
- its own Scene/Tile binding;
- freshly generated dynamic inventory.

The template machine's current live inventory is **not** copied.

You can remove the template in either location:

- **Dynamic Vendit → Clear Auto-Tile Template**, or
- **Dynamic Network → Clear Template**.

Automatic Tile creation can remain enabled with no template; in that state new matching Tiles use the global Vendit defaults.

## Dynamic network behavior

- 3–6 generated products by default.
- 2–3 Simple Calendar day inventory cycles by default.
- Background NPC purchases and occasional restocks.
- Weighted 75–115% pricing with 100% most common and discounts rare.
- CitiNet sale pings only from Vendits on Foundry's globally active Scene.
- Skipped alarm times collapse into one message rather than spamming chat.

## Data and binding safety in 1.2.x

- Rebinding a Vendit clears its previous direct Tile flag.
- Binding a Tile already owned by another Vendit repairs the old reverse link.
- Deleting a Vendit clears its direct Tile flag and removes it as the Auto-Tile Template.
- Changing a bound Vendit's ID updates its Tile flag and template reference.
- Auto-Tile clones no longer inherit the template machine's live/static inventory.
- Player purchases are GM-authoritative and serialized, preventing double-clicks or two clients from both claiming the final unit. Only Foundry's active GM processes a purchase when multiple GMs are connected.
- If Item delivery or stock persistence fails, the purchase rolls back the created Item where possible and refunds the buyer.
- Duplicate Vendit IDs are rejected before they can overwrite another machine.
- A chat-render failure cannot turn an already-completed dispense into a false purchase failure.

## API

```js
game.vendit.openManager();
game.vendit.openOptions();
game.vendit.openShop("YOUR-VENDIT-ID");
game.vendit.openDynamicManager();
game.vendit.ensureBinderMacro({ repair: true, notify: true });
```

Legacy `game.venditrun(...)` remains available.
